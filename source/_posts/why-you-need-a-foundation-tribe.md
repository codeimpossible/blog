Fellow hudlie [@JDegner0129](https://github.com/JDegner0129) wrote an awesome post explaining [how Hudl works](https://medium.com/in-the-hudl/how-our-product-team-works-14dc182da9d). If you haven't read it yet, you really should. At Hudl, our product team organizes around these vertical slices of our product team, called Tribes.

A tribe can have many squads, each squad comprised of members from Development, QA, Design, Product Management, Business Development, etc. Jordan describes it best:

Tribes at Hudl align closely with distinct sections of the product: “Team Sports”, “Individual Performance”, “Community”, and “Foundation”, and can be mapped pretty closely to an organization within a company.Each tribe has a particular goal and contains a number of squads that work with that goal in mind.
{% endblockquote %}

One thing we realized at Hudl was that building a great product and service is impossible if your squads can't move fast. Squads can't move fast if the infrastructure and tooling are getting in the way or deployment is too complicated.

Imagine trying to deploy 90+ times a day if your build process was 14 steps long, and required a bunch on arcane incantations on various machines to accomplish it.

Actually it might not be so bad if you can type like this...

This is exactly where the Foundation Tribe at Hudl comes in. We're not a customer-facing tribe in the sense that we don't interface directly with Hudl customers, but we definitely do have customers of our own: the rest of the product team at Hudl.
